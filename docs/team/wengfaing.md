## Project: Inventory Book (OneShelf)

OneShelf is an app designed as a one-stop platform for restaurant managers to handle their management needs such as having efficient inventory management 
and up-to-date information on pending deliveries, which translates to savings in man-hours and minimal losses due to over stocking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the command: `remove`
  * What it does: allows the user to remove a specified quantity from an existing item
  * Justification: This feature allows users to edit their existing inventory without having to delete and re-add an item.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=t12&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=wengfaing&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=)
