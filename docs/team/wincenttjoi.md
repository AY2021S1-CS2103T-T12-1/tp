## Project: Inventory Book (OneShelf)

OneShelf is an app designed to automate the managing of stock inventory for business owners which translates to savings in man-hours and minimal losses due to over stocking.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Wincenttjoi&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=functional-code~test-code)


* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v1.2b` on GitHub

  * What it does: Allows users to have easy reference when they want to start learning OneShelf.
