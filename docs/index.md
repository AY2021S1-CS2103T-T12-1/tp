**OneShelf** is a desktop application for you to manage all of restaurant inventories, 
table reservations and pending deliveries. It is easy to build and customise your inventories
by using only Command Line Interface. If you are a busy restaurant manager who prefers
to use the Command Line Interface and needs to keep track of multiple items,
 **OneShelf** is for you!
